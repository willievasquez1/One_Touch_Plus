"""CAPTCHA solving utilities for the scraping process.

This module provides functions to detect and solve CAPTCHAs (like reCAPTCHA or image-based CAPTCHAs).
It can be extended to integrate third-party solving services or manual user intervention.

    This stub function should detect if a CAPTCHA is present on the page loaded in the driver,

        driver: The web driver or browser automation instance currently on a page.
        config (dict): Scraper configuration which may include CAPTCHA solving settings.
